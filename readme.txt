Subject: Important Update: Registration for Technical Training - Topic 1

Dear Team Members,

I hope this message finds you well. We have an important update regarding the registration for our upcoming technical training session on Topic 1.

**Registration for Tuesday's Session is Closed:**
Unfortunately, registration for the Tuesday session is now closed. The registration form no longer provides an option to select Tuesday for this session.

**Registration Extension for Thursday's Session:**
Good news! Registration for the Thursday session is still open until Wednesday. If you haven't already registered or if you missed out on the Tuesday session, this is your chance to secure a spot for Thursday's session.

**Important Note:**
We would like to emphasize that the Tuesday session is now closed for registration. Please note that only those who have successfully registered for the Thursday session will receive an invitation shortly.

**Why This Matters:**
Our upcoming higher-level training on the same topic will build upon the foundational knowledge covered in the basic training sessions. Therefore, it is essential for participants to complete the basic training on each topic before advancing to the higher-level training.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in ensuring that we have a well-prepared team for our upcoming training sessions. We look forward to your active participation.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the registration process or the upcoming training sessions, please do not hesitate to reach out to [Contact Person's Name] at [Contact Email].
